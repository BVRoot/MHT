			**** trackCorners ****

Usage:

trackCorners OutDataFile -p paramFile < InDataFile

paramFile:

is the name of the parameter file containing values for parameters of
multiple hypothesis algorithm.  If not provided, the default parameter
file name, Parameters, is used.  See Toy/Parameters for a description
of the syntax.  Note that lines beginning with a semicolumn are ignored.


InDataFile:

baseName N S
N1
.
.
.
NN

contains the basename, baseName, of the files containing corners found
in each frame of the motion sequence, total number of frames, N, start
frame, S, and the number of corners per frame, N1...NN.  See
Toy/InDataFile for an example.

Each file baseName.A etc, contains the list of corners found in frame A.

Each corner is represented by a 27-dimensional vector separated by spaces.

Each corner ends with a linefeed.

The first two entries are the x,y position of the corner.

The remaining 25 entries are the intensity values of a 5x5 window
centered on the x,y position of the corner.

This 5x5 window of intensities is used to suppliment the Mahalanobis
test to validate potentially corresponding corners.

******* To turn off intensity correlation *******

If only the x,y position information is to be used, it may be
easier to provide dummy values for the 25 intensity values and set the
intensityThreshold parameter in the Parameter file to a small number,
e.g. 0.05.
Otherwise, the code in motionModel.c (::getNextState) must be modified at the point where measurements are validated to tracks.


======================================================================


OutDataFile:

is created by trackCorners.  It contains the partitioning of the
corners into corresponding tracks.

OutDataFile:

(1) lists all parameters used by the MHT tracking code,
(2) number of tracks
(3) number of false alarms
(4) the list of measurements in each track.  Format is:
	track_id number_of_measurements_in_track
	list of measurements
Note M denotes actual measurement
     S denotes a skipped measurement

			 **** drawTracks ****


The program drawTracks (in subdirectory drawTracks) can be used to
view the final segmentation.

Note: The X fallback resource file "drawTracks/X.DrawTracks" must be
placed in the user's home directory
