The mht_tracking project seeks to adapt the original MHT tracking algorithm
for use in tracking storm cells in radar images.  v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 are
official releases from the original author. The master branch, however,
has significant differences that may introduce undesired behaviors for your
application, but which are desired for storm cell tracking.

Some changes that have been made :
    * Original implementation operated until no detections were found.
      This is no longer the case and will operate until the end of data is
      is reached.
    * Cross-Correlation of no change in intensity now returns 1.0
    * Coordinates are now given as floating point numbers instead of integers.
      Coordinates of NaNs are now used for invalid points instead of integer
      zeros. Negative coordinates are also allowed now.
    * Each detection now has an identification number that is read in
      from the corner data and is saved in the final tracking data.
    * Input corner data may also contain timestep data, but support for using
      this information is experimental.
